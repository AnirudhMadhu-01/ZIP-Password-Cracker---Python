# ZIP-Password-Cracker---Python
This is a python project which helps us to crack the ZIP file which is password protected<br/>


## Requirements
1.Python<br/>
2.Password protected ZIP file<br/>
3.A wordlist contains possible passwords<br/>
<br/>

## Working
This is a dicionary attack based on a wordlist that we provide. It will cross-check each password in the wordlist to the password protected zip file
whether the password is correct or not <br>
<br>
- Provide the filename of the wordlist to the code ðŸ‘‡ (Line 7)<br>
